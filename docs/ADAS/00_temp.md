# üöó What is ADAS?

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are technologies designed to **assist drivers** and **increase safety** for everyone on the road. These systems work by constantly monitoring the vehicle's surroundings to help prevent accidents.

-   :octicons-shield-24: **Increase Safety**
    
    Helps protect the driver, passengers, and other road users.
-   :octicons-bell-24: **Alerts & Warnings**
    
    Continuously updates the driver and provides timely alerts in dangerous situations.
-   :octicons-stop-24: **Intervention**
    
    Can automatically intervene by braking or steering to prevent a collision.

## üö¶ Why ADAS Came into Existence

ADAS was developed to combat the primary causes of road accidents, which are often related to human error and delayed reactions.

<div class="admonition note" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Major Causes of Accidents</p>
-   **Low driver attention** on the road.
-   **Inability to interpret** danger situations on time.
-   **Failure to take** timely corrective measures.
-   The need for automation to **sense and react** to danger faster than a human.

## üõ†Ô∏è How ADAS Helps to Increase Safety

ADAS improves road safety through various methods, from providing simple information to actively controlling the vehicle.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
-   :material-eye-outline: **Visual Information**
    
    Displays crucial information like road speed limits, lane markings, and the position of the vehicle ahead.
-   :material-bell-ring-outline: **Visual & Audio Warnings**
    
    Uses LED flashes in side mirrors, on dashboards, or emits audio tones to alert the driver of immediate danger.
-   :material-steering: **Vehicle Intervention**
    
    Automatically takes control for a short time to perform actions like sudden braking or steering to avoid a collision.

## üìú Types of ADAS

These are some of the most common ADAS technologies found in modern vehicles.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-speedometer: **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**

    Automatically adjusts vehicle speed to maintain a safe, pre-set distance from the vehicle in front.
-   :material-car-alert: **Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)**

    Detects vehicles or objects approaching from the rear when the driver is reversing.
-   :material-car-door-lock: **Vehicle Exit Alert System**

    Warns a person trying to exit the vehicle if an object (like a cyclist or another car) is approaching from behind.
-   :material-parking: **Automatic Parking**

    Assists the driver by automatically steering and sometimes braking to park the vehicle.
-   :material-road: **Lane Departure Warning & Prevention System**

    Warns the driver when the vehicle unintentionally drifts out of its lane. Can also actively steer the vehicle back into the lane.
-   :material-sign-direction-outline: **Traffic Sign Recognition System**

    Uses a camera to detect and display road signs (like speed limits) on the driver's display.
-   :material-collision: **Forward Collision Warning**

    Alerts the driver of an impending collision with the vehicle in front, giving them time to brake or steer.
-   :material-car-side: **Blind Spot Monitor System**

    Detects objects in the vehicle's blind spot and warns the driver via a visual or audio alert.
-   :material-camera-iris: **Surrounding View System**

    Provides a 360-degree view of the vehicle's surroundings, making parking and low-speed maneuvering easier.
