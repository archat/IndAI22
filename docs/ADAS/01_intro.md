## What is ADAS ?
 ADAS – Advanced Driver Assitance Systems

- It is the term used for systems which assist / help drivers to increase the safety of the passengers, driver and 
other road users while driving the vehicle. (say, car, Truck, etc.)

driver can successfully take the immediate corrective actions and can avoid the accident.

## Why ADAS came into existence ?
 - Major causes of road accidents were founded as:
 - Low attention of driver on road during driving
 - Not able to interpret the danger situation on time
 - Not able to take corrective measures in time

and alert driver about it. 
- Also, if required can intervene the driver for short time and take corrective actions like braking, steering, 
etc. to avoid accident.
- Means systems which can assist drivers while driving on road to avoid accidents.

- Led indicator in front display of driver
- Audio tones 
- ……..

- By interfering the vehicle motion
- Sudden brake of vehicle if collision situation arise
- Manuevering the vehicle when it leaves the lane unintentionally

## What are these systems ?
- Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
- Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) system
- Vehicle Exit Alert System
- Automatic Parking
- Lane Departure Warning and Prevention System
- Traffic Sign recognition System
- Forward collision Warning
- Blind Spot Monitor System
- Surrounding View System
- ……………

## Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
- This Driver assistance system automatically adjust the vehicle speed with respect to the vehicle moving in 
front in the same lane. 
- After activating the system, driver can set the safe distance and then ACC automatically increase or 
decrease the vehicle speed as per the speed of the front vehicle to maintain the preset safe distance.

## Vehicle Exit Alert System
- When driver opens the gate to come out of the vehicle, there are chances that some person, bicycle or 
vehicle coming from rear. 
- This system detects such objects near the vehicle and gives the warning in form of visual indication. 
- This Driver assistance system works when the door is tried to open

## Lane Departure Warning and Prevention System
- This Driver assitance system constantly detects the lane of the vehicle and when vehicle starts leaving the 
lane unintentionally, it warns the driver.
- If the driver fails to take corrective action in time, then the system automatically manuevers the vehicle 
back in the lane. 
- Hence, it avoid accident due to other side crossing vehicles
